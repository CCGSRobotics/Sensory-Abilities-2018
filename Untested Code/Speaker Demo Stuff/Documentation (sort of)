Hi there,

This file is essentially a list of issues that have appeared while testing this code on the pi.

1. The audio output is garbled (extremely unclear):
	- This is most likely because the internet connection between the client and the server is poor.
	- It is also possible that the microphone is spoilt or broken. In which needs to be checked with code that is not reliant on internt.
	- The speaker output is going back into the microphone (because they are close together) and is causing a loop. This may spoil both the speaker and the microphone.
	- The code has some overlooked bugs which MUST BE REPORTED IMMEDIATELY.
