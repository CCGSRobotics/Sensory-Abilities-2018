# Using ImageAI Python Library for Model Training and Prediction

## Introduction

> Includes training code and (WIP) prediction code.
> Basic hazmat images are included however a large amount more is needed for a reliable model. For a good model to be built you're looking at at least 400 images per hazmat label (24800 images). Additionally an extra 125 per hazmat label would be needed for testing (7750 images).
>Will be adding more images. 
> See [Github of ImageAI](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI).
