# Using ImageAI Python Library for Model Training and Prediction

## Introduction

> Includes training code and in time prediction code.
> Basic hazmat images are arranged in the file structure however a large amount more is needed for a reliable model. Will be adding more images. 
> See [Github of ImageAI](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI).
